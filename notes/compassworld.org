#+Title: CompassWorld Notes




There have been several properties about compass world that are worth noting here (and potentially in the final paper).




* GVFNs

- Are really finicky still, except when using TDLambda.
- When \lambda=0.0 the actions taken by the agent are really important, and in-fact this is only possible when the agent sees full sequences of leap. This is really bad, but hopefully won't be seen in further domains...


* RNNs

* IN-PROGRESS Reproducing Experiments: [1/6]
